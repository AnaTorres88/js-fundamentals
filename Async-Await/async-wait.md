## Async
Async and Await are **keywords**.
* They're "synthatic sugar" used when working with **Promises**.
* We're not using the chaining method **then**.
* **Async** should go previous to the *function*, that makes it asynchronous.
* **Await** goes inside async functions, makes JS waits until the **Promise** settles and returns the result.
